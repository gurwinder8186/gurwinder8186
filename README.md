Iâ€™m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a solid foundation in web development, which I gained through a comprehensive boot camp at Dev Academy. During the program, I gained hands-on experience with group projects, pair programming, and personal initiatives, becoming proficient in tools like React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, SQLite3, Knex, Express, Git, and Docker

For my final project at Dev Academy, I worked with a team of three to create **Bite-Share**, a web app designed to reduce hunger and food waste by connecting individuals with surplus food to those in need.  
- **Role:** Backend and Vibes Lead  
- Managed migration tables, seeded data, implemented database query functions, and defined backend routes.  
- Contributed to the frontend, ensuring smooth backend integration with the user interface.  
- Facilitated daily stand-ups, and scheduled breaks, and fostered a positive team dynamic.  

This project showcased my full-stack development skills and highlighted the power of collaboration in solving real-world problems.

ðŸŽ¯ **Whatâ€™s Next**

Iâ€™m building an e-commerce platform to refine my skills in web development and deepen my understanding of React concepts from the book The Road to React. In my free time, youâ€™ll find me completing coding challenges, attending meetups, or working on personal projects that push my boundaries. Iâ€™m also reflecting on everything Iâ€™ve learned during bootcamp while exploring new opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and grow as a developer.
